# Duckyscript2VBScript Â©
This is an Duckyscript to VBscript(visual basic script) converter.
I created this in vb.net(visual basic .net) in visual studio 2015 community edition(free).
The project files are located in the source/project.
The compiled exe's are in compiled/release.
# Note:
If you type "string" in textbox1 it will not change in textbox2 you need to type "STRING" this is with all the DuckyScript commands, like "ENTER", "GUI", the arrow keys and further.
You can edit my Source code, but you can't publish it by yourself. You need to ask me if I want to edit the code in the Source.
